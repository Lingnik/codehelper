Here is a Ruby function that uses the `git` command to push a repository to GitHub:

```ruby
# Pushes the repository to GitHub
def push_to_github
  # Assumes that the current directory is the root of the repository
  # Assumes that the repository has already been initialized and has a remote named "origin" pointing to the GitHub repository
  # Assumes that the user has already set up SSH authentication with GitHub
  system("git push origin master")
end
```

This function assumes that the current directory is the root of the repository, that the repository has already been initialized and has a remote named "origin" pointing to the GitHub repository, and that the user has already set up SSH authentication with GitHub.
