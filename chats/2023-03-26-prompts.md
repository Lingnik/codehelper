I'm writing a chat agent with ChatGPT that integrates with the GitHub API to help a human write a complete software project. To break this down, the agent will be capable of performing the following high-level tasks:
1. Design a software specification based on a user's high-level requirements.
2. Break down that specification into work items, creating them as GitHub Issues.
3. Assign itself GitHub Issues tagged 'approved-for-codehelper'.
4. Respond to comments on approved-for-codehelper GitHub Issues to clarify ambiguous situations until it is clear enough to proceed with development.
5. Develop code using GPT that integrates seamlessly into the project, and submit Pull Requests for those issues when they are complete
6. Respond to comments on Pull Requests and make additional commits until the Pull Request is approved by a human.

So far, I have collaborated with GPT to solve some, but not all, of these requirements. GPT has written the majority of the code based on our conversations, but I have done most of the typing. In the near-term, I would like to be able to take a step back and leverage the tooling we have built to continue building this "codehelper" agent, as opposed to typing the code into my editor myself.

Please review the code we have, and:
1. Summarize which of the above high-level tasks have been addressed or not. For those which still have gaps, summarize those gaps.
2. Propose a series of steps that will assist in my near-term goal of not pasting the code into my editor myself.

Note that one of my chief concerns right now is that the code that codehelper generates and pushes as pull requests is not seamlessly integrated into the project, but rather a series of disparate scripts.

```
Title: 1. Set up the initial Rails project structure
Body:
- Install Rails gem
- Create a new Rails project
- Initialize Git repository
- Add initial commit with Rails project structure
- Create a .gitignore file with standard Rails exclusions
- Push the repository to GitHub
```

The code follows:
```
```




Please analyze the existing code structure and layout. All of these ruby files are in the root of the project at the moment. Based on my understanding of the problem, at a minimum we will need to send additional context in the prompt to `openai_client.generate_code`, including:
1. A directory listing of the project.
2. A list of classes and functions available in each ruby file.
3. The contents of each ruby file. I'm not sure how to handle the case of reading non-ruby files in the project, but let's solve that later.

I also suspect openai_client.generate_code's response will need to be more complex than code, now, and should include:
1. A set of zero or more files, instead of just one, which need to be created.
2. A set of zero or more existing files which need to be modified.

Since each task will be building on the last, each task will need to be provided with the additional context from the prior tasks.

Please propose revisions to this approach if you believe there is a better approach.



Then, please provide me working code so that generate_code_from_issue function places the generated code correctly.

Please analyze the existing code structure and complete the TODOs in gh_generate_code_from_issue.rb.
